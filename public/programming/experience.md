# Programming Experience
This section details the languages, libraries, and toolkits I’m familiar with.

## Languages

### Proficient
These are languages I’ve worked with more extensively. I know them pretty well and use them actively, and have worked
with extra libraries as well.

- Scala
- Python
- Haskell

### Learning
These are languages I’ve worked with a little bit. I’m not super familiar with some of the more complex parts of the
language or extra libraries, but can work on it in a pinch.

- Rust
- C++
- C#
- Bash
- MIPS Assembly

### Purgatory
In my opinion, these languages are abominations against God. I have used them before, and never want to again.

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Java

## Libraries and Toolkits

### Proficient
These are libraries or toolkits I’ve worked with more extensively. I know them pretty well and use them actively.

- Selenium (Python)
- Docker

### Learning
These are libraries and toolkits I’ve worked with a little bit. I’m not super familiar with some of the more complex
parts of them, but can use them in a pinch.

- OpenCV (Python)
- Unity (C#)
- Pandas (Python)
- Play Framework (Scala)
- Kubernetes

### Want to Learn
I have little to no experience with these libraries and toolkits, but would be very interested in learning more about
their use.

- Apache Kafka (Scala)
- OpenGL (C++ or Rust)
- Dear ImGUI (C++, or Rust bindings)

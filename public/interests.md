# Interests

## Backend Software Development
I definitely have interest in backend software development, especially involving data processing and database 
management.

## Functional Programming
The functional programming paradigm is of great interest to me (as shown by my usage of functional languages, such as 
Scala and Haskell). The removal of mutable state and side effects makes code easier to debug, less error prone, and also
improves parallel processing capabilities.

## Parallelization and Multi-threaded Computation
Multi-threaded processing poses a unique challenge in programming. Sure, it helps to have more processes going on at
once, but making that happen takes a lot of work on the developer’s end. I want to learn more about asynchronous and
parallel computing so that I can apply those to my projects more readily and greatly improve efficiency.

## Audio Engineering
I’m interested in working with audio production and processing, especially analog synthesis. I would love to work with
it more as a hobby, either through software or hardware development.

## Right to Privacy on the Internet
Privacy is a human right, and government and big tech companies infringe on that right every single time you connect
your computer to the internet. Every website you use has some kind of tracking or advertising, which can be used to
monitor your every action. Not just on the internet, but in your day-to-day life.

## Making a New IDE
The current options of IDEs are featureful, with expansive language coverage, debugging features, and project 
management. However, they are inefficient (usually in languages on my purgatory list), memory-heavy, and some make
questionable decisions in terms of infrastructure (seriously, VSCode? In Electron?!) I want to create a new IDE using a
fast, lightweight, modular engine (hopefully in a system level language, such as C++ or Rust), using an efficient GUI
framework (for example, Dear ImGUI), with compatibility with existing common formats for syntax highlighting or code
completion, but also more integrated language server implementations that can replace those in the future. I will post
more details eventually.
